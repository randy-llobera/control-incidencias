  - `IncidentWithDetails` - Incident with all related data

#### Type Safety Improvements
- All database queries now use proper TypeScript types
- Types automatically match actual database schema
- Better IntelliSense support for database operations

### üìÅ File Changes

#### Modified Files
- `src/types/database.ts` - Now imports Supabase-generated types
- `src/lib/supabase-server.ts` - Fixed async/await for server-side rendering
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript type issues
- `src/app/usuarios/page.tsx` - Updated to use proper relationship types
- `src/app/categorias/page.tsx` - Updated to use proper relationship types
