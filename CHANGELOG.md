## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Detailed changelog tracking system

## [2024-12-19] - Database Security & Admin Permissions Fix

### üîí **Critical Security Fix**

#### Admin Permissions Issue

- **BREAKING**: Fixed critical issue where Admins couldn't perform any operations on other users
- **Root Cause**: Missing RLS policies for admin users on the `users` table
- **Impact**: Admins were completely blocked from user management functionality

#### New Database Function

- **Added**: `public.is_admin()` function
  - Security definer function to safely check admin status
  - Prevents recursion and security issues
  - Properly secured with role-based access control
  - Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` with `set search_path = public`

#### New RLS Policies

- **Added**: Complete admin CRUD policies for `users` table:
  - `"Admins can view all users"` - SELECT all user records
  - `"Admins can insert users"` - INSERT new user records
  - `"Admins can update users"` - UPDATE any user record
  - `"Admins can delete users"` - DELETE any user record

#### Security Improvements

- **Enhanced**: Proper function security with `REVOKE ALL` and `GRANT EXECUTE`
- **Maintained**: Existing user self-management policies
- **Preserved**: All other table policies remain unchanged

### üìÅ **File Changes**

#### Modified Files

- `supabase/README.md` - Added admin policies and helper function

### ‚úÖ **Impact**

#### Functionality Restored

- ‚úÖ Admins can now view all users in `/usuarios` page
- ‚úÖ Admins can now update user roles
- ‚úÖ Admins can now create new users
- ‚úÖ Admins can now delete users
- ‚úÖ All admin functionality working as intended

#### Security Maintained

- ‚úÖ RLS policies properly restrict access by role
- ‚úÖ Users can still only manage their own profiles
- ‚úÖ Function security properly implemented
- ‚úÖ No privilege escalation vulnerabilities

### üö® **Critical Fix Required**

**This fix must be applied to production immediately** as it restores core admin functionality that was completely broken.

**SQL to Apply:**

```sql
-- Add the helper function
create or replace function public.is_admin()
returns boolean
language sql
stable
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
  select exists (
    select 1
    from public.users u
    join public.roles r on r.id = u.role_id
    where u.id = auth.uid()
      and r.name = 'admin'
  );
$$;

-- Secure the function
revoke all on function public.is_admin() from public;
grant execute on function public.is_admin() to authenticated, anon;

-- Add admin policies
create policy "Admins can view all users"
on public.users for select
using ( public.is_admin() );

create policy "Admins can insert users"
on public.users for insert
with check ( public.is_admin() );

create policy "Admins can update users"
on public.users for update
using ( public.is_admin() );

create policy "Admins can delete users"
on public.users for delete
using ( public.is_admin() );
```
